  <h2>What is a profit?</h2>
  <p>A profit is an amount of money that you gain when you are paid more for something than itcost you to make, get, or do it.</p>
  <p> Income minus all expenses.

Example: Sam's Bakery received $900 yesterday, but expenses such as wages, food and electricity came to $650. So the Profit was $900 − $650 = $250.


But if the income is LESS THAN the expenses it is called a "Loss".

Example: Two days ago Sam's Bakery received $480, but expenses were $520.
$480 − $520 = −$40, which is a $40 Loss</p>
